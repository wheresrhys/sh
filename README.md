# Stotles Backend Enginer work sample assignment

## Problem statement

All the instructions are available [here](https://www.notion.so/stotles/Backend-engineer-work-sample-assignment-15b1dd4d10d3430a8735cd3b2f12ade7).

### Summary of requirements

See the instructions (linked above) for warm-up task and full problem statement.

The core requirements are:

1. Fix the failing test so that we can correctly parse transaction amounts.
2. `fetch-transaction-data` should load all files published since 2020 from the following links:
   1. https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/spending-over-25-000
   2. https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dft-departmental-spending-over-25000
3. A new API `/api/top_suppliers` should accept a POST request containing (optional) buyer name and time range (from/to timestamps in ISO format) and return an object containing an array supplier names & total values

   Sample request:

   ```tsx
   {
      "buyer_name": "HMRC",
      "from_date": "20210101",
      "to_date": "20210131",
   }
   ```

   or:

   ```tsx
   {
      "from_date": "20210101",
      "to_date": "20210131",
   }
   ```

   Sample response:

   ```tsx
   {
      "top_suppliers": [
         { "name": "Stotles", "total_amount": 1234567.0 }
      ]
   }
   ```

4. In the README file, please make a note of the result of the query for HMRC for all transactions in 2021.

## Code structure

The codebase is composed of:

- `load-file.main.ts` - script used to load a single CSV file from disk
- `fetch-transaction-data.main.ts` - script used to fetch data from gov.uk API
- `query-service.main.ts` - HTTP API server for querying the data

Some shared code has been extracted to other files - `db.ts` & `scraperUtils.ts` -
feel free to refactor the code more if needed.

### Libraries

The code makes use of the following libraries:

- expressjs - [documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
- knex - [documentation](https://knexjs.org/)
- luxon - [documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/)

## Getting started

You can run `ts-node` to execute each of these or use scripts defined in package.json:

```bash
# Starts the query service with --watch so it auto-reloads
npm run dev-query-service
# Runs the scraper
npm run dev-fetch-transaction-data
# Runs the file loader
npm run dev-load-file
```

The first time you run any script that accesses the db (calls `getDBConnection()`),
it will create db.sqlite3 file if it doesn't exist.

At any point you can delete that file and it will be recreated from scratch.

### Browsing the database

You should start by looking at the migration in `./migrations` folder.
If you prefer to browse the DB using SQL, you can use the sqlite command line (just run `sqlite3 ./db.sqlite3`)
or any other SQL client that supports sqlite.

If for any reason the database becomes unusable, you can just delete the db.sqlite3 file and it will be recreated (including running the migrations) next time you run any script.

### Disabling/Enabling TypeScript

If you prefer to completely disable TypeScript for a file, add `// @ts-nocheck` on the first line.
If you just want to disable strict type checking, modify `tsconfig.json` according to your needs.

# Candidate's notes

- I've left quite a few comments in the code
- I generally run eslint and prettier in `--fix` mode on any projects I set up, and rely on that to fix indentation, consistent quote marks etc. Hence there are probably a few messy bits in my solution (hopefully not too illegible though!)
- Final data result for the exercise saved as result.json
